# Propeller SDET Test - Viktorija Todosieva

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the tests

Make sure the API is running first:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
docker-compose run --rm seed
```

Then run the tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Bugs found and fixed

### Bug #1 — Status filter inverted
**File:** `src/product/product.service.ts`

**Exposed by:** `Products filtering › should filter products by status ACTIVE` and `should filter products by status INACTIVE` - tests expected products with the requested status but received products with the opposite status.

**Problem:** The filter logic was inverted — when filtering for `ACTIVE` it queried for `INACTIVE` and vice versa.

**Fix:** Swapped the values to match the expected behavior.

### Bug #2 — Tenant isolation broken in findOne
**File:** `src/product/product.service.ts`

**Exposed by:**
- `Tenancy isolation › should not return tenant-a product to tenant-b by id` — tenant-b requested product id 1 and received tenant-a's product back instead of an error
- `Product image relationships › should not return tenant-b product images to tenant-a` — tenant-b requested product id 1 and received tenant-a's product along with tenant-a's images

**Problem:** The `findOne` method received `tenantId` as a parameter but never used it in the database query, it only filtered by `id`. This allowed any tenant to access any other tenant's products directly by ID.

**Fix:** Added `tenantId` to the `where` clause:

**Note:** After the fix, requesting another tenant's product by ID correctly throws a `NotFoundException` since the product doesn't exist for that tenant.

### Bug #3 — Missing image priority validation and wrong default value
**File:** `src/image/image.dto.ts`, `src/image/image.entity.ts`, `src/main.ts`

**Exposed by:**
- `Validation › should return error when creating image with invalid priority below minimum` — creating an image with priority 0 succeeded when it should have failed
- `Validation › should return error when creating image with invalid priority above maximum` — creating an image with priority 1001 succeeded when it should have failed
- `Validation › should create an image with default priority of 100` — creating an image without priority returned 0 instead of 100

**Problem:** Three issues combined:
1. No validation was enforced on the priority field — any number was accepted
2. The default priority in the entity was `0` instead of `100` as documented in the README
3. `ValidationPipe` was not set up in `main.ts` so class-validator decorators had no effect

**Fix:**
- Added `ValidationPipe` to `main.ts`
- Added `@Min(1)` and `@Max(1000)` decorators to priority in `CreateImageInput` and `UpdateImageInput`
- Added `@IsOptional()` to priority in `UpdateImageInput` so validation is skipped when priority is not provided in an update
- Changed default priority in `image.entity.ts` from `0` to `100`

### Bug #4 — Pagination wrong offset
**File:** `src/product/product.service.ts`

**Exposed by:**
- `Products filtering › should filter products by name` — filtering by name "bolt" returned 0 results despite matching products existing in the database
- `Products filtering › should filter products by name and price range` — filtering by name and price range returned 0 results despite matching products existing

**Problem:** The pagination offset was calculated incorrectly. With the default `page=1` and `pageSize=10`, the query was skipping the first 10 records instead of 0, causing most queries to return incorrect or empty results.

**Fix:** Changed the skip calculation to use `(page - 1) * pageSize` instead of `page * pageSize` so that page 1 correctly starts from the first record.

### Bug #5 — Missing business rule validation on product creation
**File:** `src/product/product.dto.ts`

**Exposed by:**
- `Validation › should return error when creating product with empty name` — creating a product with an empty name succeeded when it should have failed
- `Validation › should return error when creating product with negative price` — creating a product with a negative price succeeded when it should have failed

**Problem:** GraphQL schema validation only checks that required fields are present and of the correct type. It does not validate business rules — empty strings and negative numbers are valid types but invalid values for a product.

**Fix:** Added `@IsNotEmpty()` to the name field and `@IsPositive()` to the price field in `CreateProductInput`. Since `ValidationPipe` was already set up, these decorators were applied immediately.

**Note:** This was not explicitly documented in the README as a requirement, but was identified as missing business rule validation during edge case testing.

### Bug #6 — Price field type mismatch between GraphQL and database
**File:** `src/product/product.entity.ts`, `src/product/product.dto.ts`

**Exposed by:**
- `Product mutations › should create a product` — creating a product with a decimal price like `9.99` failed with `invalid input syntax for type integer`

**Problem:** The GraphQL schema declared `price` as `Float` (supporting decimals) but the database column was `int` (integers only). This caused any decimal price value to be rejected by the database.

**Fix:** Changed `@Field(() => Float)` to `@Field(() => Int)` in the entity and all price fields in the DTO to align with the database column type.

**Note:** The ideal fix for a real e-commerce system would be to change the database column to `decimal(10,2)` to properly support decimal prices. However since the seeder uses whole numbers and shouldn't be modified, the GraphQL type was aligned to match the existing database schema.

## Assumptions
- Price was changed from `Float` to `Int` to match the existing database schema since the seeder cannot be modified. In a real production system this should be `decimal(10,2)`.
- Empty product name and negative price validation were added as business rule validations despite not being explicitly documented, as they represent clearly invalid product states.
